# Program5

This is to help us all stay organized through these next two assignments. If there are any issues we can talk in person, on here, or on groupme. 
Just so we do not have to go back and forth to remember our roles, here is what was on the roles sheet (Hwk 5.1):

Donovan: Leader, prtTraversalChron, maxStepsChron.

Angela: Insertion, prtOne, PrtAll, prtFlight, prtTraversal.

Daniel: Driver, Test Data

Of course, we should all be available to help with anything, this is why I think Github is a decent place to get this done. If there are any problems we can always talk about it in class or in the cs lab.

To download any of the files, click on "raw", right-click, then "save as". 

If you aren't familiar with how to use GitHub, there's a quick tutorial on the site that's helpful in getting the basics. It's really all you need to get up and running. 

Good luck!
